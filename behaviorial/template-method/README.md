# Template Method Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Template Method design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines the structure of an algorithm in a base class but allows subclasses to override specific steps of the algorithm without changing its overall structure. This pattern is particularly useful when you have a common algorithm that can be customized by subclasses. The Template Method pattern simplifies code by allowing you to define a fixed sequence of steps in a base class while letting subclasses provide specific implementations.

## Intent

The Template Method pattern aims to:

- Define the structure of an algorithm in a base class while allowing subclasses to override specific steps.
- Provide a fixed sequence of steps that can be customized by subclasses.
- Promote code reuse by defining common behavior in a base class and letting subclasses provide specific details.

## Motivation

In software development, there are often situations where a common algorithm needs to be executed, but some of its steps may vary depending on the context. For example, when generating reports, the steps for collecting data, processing data, and formatting it are common, but the specifics of each step may vary based on the report type (e.g., PDF, Excel).

The Template Method pattern addresses this by defining a common template for the algorithm in a base class and allowing subclasses to implement the details. This approach provides a clear and consistent way to manage variations in the algorithm, making it easier to maintain and extend.

## Structure

The Template Method pattern consists of the following components:

- **Abstract Class**: Defines the template method that outlines the algorithm's structure and provides common steps. It includes abstract methods for the steps that can be customized by subclasses.
- **Concrete Subclass**: Implements the abstract methods defined in the base class to provide specific behavior for the algorithm's steps.

The typical flow of the Template Method pattern involves the following steps:

1. Define the **Abstract Class** with a template method that specifies the fixed sequence of steps.
2. Implement the abstract methods in **Concrete Subclasses** to provide specific behavior for each step.
3. Use the concrete subclass to execute the algorithm with the customized behavior.

## Participants

The main participants in the Template Method pattern are:

- **Abstract Class**: Declares the template method that defines the algorithm's structure and includes abstract methods for customizable steps.
- **Concrete Subclass**: Provides implementations for the abstract methods, defining the specific behavior for each step of the algorithm.

## Usage

To implement the Template Method pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Abstract Class**: Create an abstract class that includes a template method defining the algorithm's structure. Include abstract methods for steps that can be customized by subclasses.

2. **Implement Concrete Subclasses**: Create subclasses that provide specific implementations for the abstract methods, customizing the behavior of the algorithm's steps.

3. **Client Code**: Use the concrete subclass to execute the algorithm, leveraging the predefined structure while customizing specific steps as needed.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Template Method pattern to manage algorithms with varying steps, ensuring a consistent structure while allowing for customization.

## Variation

**Hooks**

- **Hooks**: The Template Method pattern can include "hook" methods, which are optional methods that subclasses can override if needed. Hooks provide additional flexibility by allowing subclasses to extend or modify the algorithm's behavior without requiring changes to the base class.

The choice to use hooks depends on the specific requirements of the algorithm and how much flexibility is needed for customization.
