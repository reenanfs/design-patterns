# Behavioral Design Patterns

Behavioral design patterns focus on the interaction and communication between objects, defining how they collaborate to accomplish specific behaviors and responsibilities. These patterns help in achieving flexible and maintainable designs by providing solutions for managing complex behaviors and relationships.

The following behavioral design patterns will be included in this folder:

- Observer Pattern: Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects, where changes in one object trigger updates in dependent objects.
- Strategy Pattern: Enables dynamic selection of algorithms or strategies at runtime, encapsulating them in separate classes and making them interchangeable.
- Command Pattern: Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue or log requests, and support undoable operations.
- Template Method Pattern: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in a base class, allowing subclasses to override certain steps of the algorithm without changing its structure.
- Iterator Pattern: Provides a way to access elements of an aggregate object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
- State Pattern: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes, encapsulating each state in a separate class.
- Chain of Responsibility Pattern: Avoids coupling the sender of a request to its receivers by giving multiple objects a chance to handle the request.
- Visitor Pattern: Defines a new operation to be performed on the elements of an object structure without changing the classes of the elements.

Each pattern has its own directory within the "behavioral" folder, containing the implementation code and a README.md file with detailed explanations and usage examples.

## Usage

To explore the different behavioral design patterns, navigate to the respective pattern's directory and refer to the README.md file. Each README provides an introduction for the pattern, its intent, motivation, structure, participants, and usage examples. It also includes implementation code in various programming languages.

Feel free to use and modify the code examples according to your requirements. Contributions to this repository are also welcome!

## Pattern Directory Structure

The "behavioral" folder will be organized as follows:

- `observer/`: Contains the implementation of the Observer pattern.
- `strategy/`: Contains the implementation of the Strategy pattern.
- `command/`: Contains the implementation of the Command pattern.
- `template-method/`: Contains the implementation of the Template Method pattern.
- `iterator/`: Contains the implementation of the Iterator pattern.
- `state/`: Contains the implementation of the State pattern.
- `chain-of-responsibility/`: Contains the implementation of the Chain of Responsibility pattern.
- `visitor/`: Contains the implementation of the Visitor pattern.

Each pattern directory typically contains the following structure:

- `language1/`: Contains the implementation code for the pattern in the specified language.
- `language2/`: Contains the implementation code for the pattern in another language.
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the pattern, including its intent, motivation, structure, participants, and usage examples.
