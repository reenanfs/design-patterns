# Mediator Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Mediator design pattern is a behavioral pattern that defines an object that encapsulates how a set of objects interact. This pattern promotes loose coupling by preventing objects from referring to each other explicitly and allows them to communicate through a mediator. The Mediator pattern is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to manage complex communication between multiple objects while keeping them decoupled.

## Intent

The Mediator pattern aims to:

- Define an object that coordinates interactions between other objects.
- Reduce the dependency between objects by preventing them from referring to each other directly.
- Simplify communication and management of complex interactions by centralizing control in a mediator.

## Motivation

In software systems, objects often need to communicate with each other to perform complex operations. Without a central point of control, this can lead to tightly coupled code, making it hard to maintain and extend. For example, in a chat application, multiple components like users, chat rooms, and message services need to interact, and managing these interactions directly can become cumbersome.

The Mediator pattern addresses this by introducing a mediator object that handles all interactions between components. This approach centralizes communication and reduces the dependencies between objects, making the system more modular and easier to manage.

## Structure

The Mediator pattern consists of the following components:

- **Mediator**: Defines an interface for communicating with colleague objects. It contains methods to manage and facilitate communication between objects.
- **ConcreteMediator**: Implements the Mediator interface and coordinates communication between colleague objects.
- **Colleague**: Defines an interface for communication with the mediator. Each colleague object communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.
- **ConcreteColleague**: Implements the Colleague interface and interacts with other colleagues through the mediator.

The typical flow of the Mediator pattern involves the following steps:

1. Define the **Mediator** interface to declare methods for communication between colleague objects.
2. Implement the **ConcreteMediator** to manage interactions and coordinate communication between colleagues.
3. Create **Colleague** classes that interact with each other through the mediator.
4. Implement **ConcreteColleague** classes to define specific behaviors and use the mediator to communicate.

## Participants

The main participants in the Mediator pattern are:

- **Mediator**: Declares methods for communicating with colleague objects.
- **ConcreteMediator**: Implements the mediator interface and manages communication between colleagues.
- **Colleague**: Defines an interface for communication with the mediator.
- **ConcreteColleague**: Implements the colleague interface and communicates with other colleagues through the mediator.

## Usage

To implement the Mediator pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Mediator Interface**: Create an interface that declares methods for managing communication between colleagues.

2. **Implement the ConcreteMediator**: Develop a concrete mediator class that implements the mediator interface and coordinates interactions between colleague objects.

3. **Create Colleague Classes**: Design classes that communicate with each other through the mediator interface.

4. **Implement ConcreteColleagues**: Create concrete colleague classes that implement the colleague interface and use the mediator to facilitate communication.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Mediator pattern to manage complex interactions between objects while maintaining loose coupling and modularity.

## Variation

**Colleague-to-Mediator Communication**

- **Colleague-to-Mediator Communication**: In the Mediator pattern, colleague objects should not communicate directly with other colleagues but should interact through the mediator. This approach ensures that the mediator remains the central point of control and helps manage the complexity of interactions between objects.

The choice to use this communication style depends on the specific needs of your system and how you want to manage object interactions.
