# State Design Pattern

## Introduction

The State design pattern is a behavioral pattern that allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is particularly useful when an object must change its behavior at runtime depending on its state. The State pattern simplifies state-specific behavior by organizing it into separate state classes and delegating state-related behavior to these classes.

## Intent

The State pattern aims to:

- Allow an object to change its behavior when its internal state changes.
- Encapsulate state-specific behavior into separate classes.
- Promote code maintainability by organizing state-specific behavior and transitions.

## Motivation

In software development, there are often situations where an object's behavior depends on its state. For example, an audio player may have different behavior when it is playing, paused, or stopped. Handling state-specific behavior within a single class can lead to complex and hard-to-maintain code.

The State pattern addresses this by encapsulating state-specific behavior into separate classes. This approach makes it easier to add new states or modify existing states without changing the context class, promoting code maintainability and flexibility.

## Structure

The State pattern consists of the following components:

- **State Interface**: Defines the interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.
- **Concrete State**: Implements the behavior associated with a state of the context.
- **Context**: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state.

The typical flow of the State pattern involves the following steps:

1. Define the **State Interface** that declares methods for state-specific behavior.
2. Implement the **Concrete State** classes that provide specific behavior for different states.
3. Create a **Context** class that maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass and delegates state-specific behavior to this instance.
4. The **Context** class changes its state instance in response to internal events, thereby changing its behavior.

## Participants

The main participants in the State pattern are:

- **State**: Defines an interface for encapsulating the behavior associated with a particular state of the context.
- **Concrete State**: Implements the behavior associated with a state of the context.
- **Context**: Maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass that defines the current state and delegates state-specific behavior to this instance.

## Usage

To implement the State pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the State Interface**: Create an interface that declares methods for state-specific behavior.
2. **Implement Concrete State Classes**: Implement classes that provide specific behavior for different states.
3. **Create the Context Class**: Implement a class that maintains an instance of a ConcreteState subclass and delegates state-specific behavior to this instance.
4. **Change State as Needed**: Implement methods in the context class to change its current state in response to internal events.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the State pattern to manage state-specific behavior and transitions, ensuring a clear and maintainable structure.

## Variation

**Transition Actions**

- **Transition Actions**: In addition to encapsulating state-specific behavior, the State pattern can include actions that occur during state transitions. These actions can be implemented in the context class or the concrete state classes, providing additional flexibility in managing state transitions.

The choice to use transition actions depends on the specific requirements of the context and how much control is needed over state transitions.
