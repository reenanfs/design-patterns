# Design Patterns Repository

Welcome to the Design Patterns Repository! This repository is a collection of commonly used design patterns implemented in various programming languages. Design patterns are reusable solutions to common software design problems, and they help in creating flexible, maintainable, and scalable code.

## Introduction

The goal of this repository is to provide a comprehensive reference of design patterns that can be easily understood and implemented in real-world projects. Each design pattern is organized into its own directory, containing code examples and explanations.

Please note that this repository is a work in progress, and more design patterns will be added over time.

## Design Patterns

The repository is structured into the following categories:

- Creational Patterns
- Behavioral Patterns
- Structural Patterns

Inside each category, you will find separate directories for each design pattern, organized as follows:

- `creational`
  - `pattern-name`
    - `language1`
    - `language2`
    - ...
- `behavioral`
  - `pattern-name`
    - `language1`
    - `language2`
    - ...
- `structural`
  - `pattern-name`
    - `language1`
    - `language2`
    - ...

For example, to find the implementation of the Builder design pattern in Python, you would navigate to `creational/singleton/python`.

Each pattern directory contains:

- **Code examples**: Code snippets or full-fledged implementations demonstrating the pattern's usage.
- **README**: A detailed explanation of the pattern, including its intent, motivation, structure, participants, and a step-by-step guide on how to implement it.

Please check back regularly as new design patterns will be added to the repository.
