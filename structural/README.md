# Structural Design Patterns

Structural design patterns focus on how classes and objects are composed to form larger structures while keeping these structures flexible and efficient. These patterns aim to facilitate the composition of objects, allowing for new functionalities to be added without changing the existing code.

The following structural design patterns will be included in this folder:

- **Adapter Pattern**: Allows objects with incompatible interfaces to work together by providing a wrapper (adapter) that translates one interface to another.
- **Bridge Pattern**: Decouples an abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently and be extended independently.
- **Composite Pattern**: Composes objects into tree-like structures to represent part-whole hierarchies, allowing clients to treat individual objects and compositions uniformly.
- **Decorator Pattern**: Dynamically adds responsibilities to objects by using wrappers or decorators, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing for extending functionality.
- **Facade Pattern**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem, simplifying interactions and providing a higher-level interface to clients.
- **Flyweight Pattern**: Shares common state between multiple objects to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
- **Proxy Pattern**: Acts as a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access and provide additional functionalities.

Each pattern has its own directory within the "structural" folder, containing the implementation code and a README.md file with detailed explanations and usage examples.

## Usage

To explore the different structural design patterns, navigate to the respective pattern's directory and refer to the README.md file. Each README provides an introduction for the pattern, its intent, motivation, structure, participants, and usage examples. It also includes implementation code in various programming languages.

Feel free to use and modify the code examples according to your requirements. Contributions to this repository are also welcome!

## Pattern Directory Structure

The "structural" folder will be organized as follows:

- `adapter/`: Contains the implementation of the Adapter pattern.
- `bridge/`: Contains the implementation of the Bridge pattern.
- `composite/`: Contains the implementation of the Composite pattern.
- `decorator/`: Contains the implementation of the Decorator pattern.
- `facade/`: Contains the implementation of the Facade pattern.
- `flyweight/`: Contains the implementation of the Flyweight pattern.
- `proxy/`: Contains the implementation of the Proxy pattern.

Each pattern directory typically contains the following structure:

- `language1/`: Contains the implementation code for the pattern in the specified language.
- `language2/`: Contains the implementation code for the pattern in another language.
- `README.md`: Provides a detailed explanation of the pattern, including its intent, motivation, structure, participants, and usage examples.

I hope this document provides the information you were looking for. If you have any further questions or need assistance with specific structural design patterns, feel free to ask!
