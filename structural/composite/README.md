# Composite Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Composite design pattern is a structural pattern that allows you to compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies. This pattern lets clients treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly. The Composite pattern is particularly useful for representing complex structures where individual components and their containers need to be treated in a consistent manner.

The Composite pattern simplifies client code by allowing you to work with individual objects and composites using the same interface. By using this pattern, you can create more flexible and maintainable systems that can easily evolve over time.

## Intent

The Composite pattern aims to:

- Compose objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.
- Allow clients to treat individual objects and compositions of objects uniformly.
- Simplify client code by enabling a consistent way to interact with both single objects and groups of objects.

## Motivation

In software development, managing complex structures that contain both individual components and groups of components can be challenging. For example, if you are building a file system with files and directories, you need a way to treat both files and directories uniformly to simplify client code.

The Composite pattern addresses this issue by defining a common interface for both individual objects and compositions. This approach allows you to build complex structures in a consistent manner, making it easier to manage and extend the system.

For example, in a graphical drawing application, shapes can be simple (like circles and rectangles) or complex (composed of multiple shapes). The Composite pattern allows you to treat all shapes uniformly, whether they are simple or composite, simplifying the rendering and manipulation of the drawing.

## Structure

The Composite pattern consists of the following components:

- **Component**: Defines the common interface for all objects in the composition, including both individual objects and compositions.
- **Leaf**: Represents individual objects in the composition that do not have any children.
- **Composite**: Represents composite objects that can have children, including both individual objects and other composites.

The typical flow of the Composite pattern involves the following steps:

1. Define the `Component` interface with common operations for both individual objects and compositions.
2. Create `Leaf` classes that implement the `Component` interface and represent individual objects.
3. Create `Composite` classes that implement the `Component` interface and manage children components.
4. Use the `Composite` classes to build complex structures by adding `Leaf` and other `Composite` instances as children.

## Participants

The main participants in the Composite pattern are:

- **Component**: Declares the interface for all objects in the composition, including operations for managing children.
- **Leaf**: Implements the `Component` interface for individual objects that do not have children.
- **Composite**: Implements the `Component` interface for composite objects that can have children and provides operations to manage them.

## Usage

To implement the Composite pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Component Interface**: Create an interface or abstract class that defines the common operations for both individual objects and compositions.

2. **Implement Leaf Classes**: Create classes that implement the `Component` interface and represent individual objects without children.

3. **Implement Composite Classes**: Create classes that implement the `Component` interface and manage children components, providing operations to add, remove, and access children.

4. **Client Code**: Use the `Component` interface to interact with both individual objects and composite objects uniformly, allowing for flexible changes in the structure.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Composite pattern to manage complex structures with both individual components and compositions, simplifying the design and improving maintainability.

## Variation

**Transparent vs. Safe Composition**

- **Transparent Composition**: All operations are defined in the `Component` interface, allowing clients to treat all objects uniformly but potentially leading to unsupported operations for leaf objects.
- **Safe Composition**: Operations specific to managing children are defined only in the `Composite` class, preventing unsupported operations on leaf objects but requiring type checks or casts for client code.

The choice between transparent and safe composition depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.
