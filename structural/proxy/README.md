# Proxy Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Proxy design pattern is a structural pattern that provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. This pattern is useful for adding functionality such as access control, logging, caching, or lazy initialization without changing the interface of the original object. Proxies can enhance the performance, security, and manageability of the system by adding layers of control and functionality.

## Intent

The Proxy pattern aims to:

- Control access to an object, adding additional functionality like logging, access control, or caching.
- Provide a placeholder for another object to enhance performance, security, or manageability.
- Allow for the implementation of lazy initialization, where the object is created only when needed.

## Motivation

In software development, there are scenarios where you might want to control access to an object, enhance its behavior, or delay its creation until it is actually needed. For example, in a network application, you may want to add logging or authentication checks before processing requests. The Proxy pattern provides a way to implement these features without changing the client code that interacts with the object.

For instance, consider a scenario where you have a service that fetches user data from a remote server. Instead of calling the service directly, you use a proxy that handles caching and network requests, reducing latency and improving performance. The Proxy pattern allows you to wrap the service object, adding these functionalities transparently.

## Structure

The Proxy pattern consists of the following components:

- **Interface**: Defines the common interface for the service and the proxy.
- **Service**: Implements the Interface and contains the real functionality.
- **Proxy**: Implements the Interface and controls access to the Service, adding additional behavior such as logging, access control, or caching.
- **Client Code**: Interacts with the Interface, allowing it to work with the Service or Proxy interchangeably.

The typical flow of the Proxy pattern involves the following steps:

1. Define the `Interface` with the common operations that the proxy and service will implement.
2. Create the `Service` class that implements the `Interface` and contains the real functionality.
3. Implement the `Proxy` class that also implements the `Interface` and controls access to the `Service`, adding any additional functionality.
4. Use the `Proxy` in the client code to interact with the `Service`, allowing the addition of features without changing the client code.

## Participants

The main participants in the Proxy pattern are:

- **Interface**: Declares the common interface for Service and Proxy.
- **Service**: Implements the Interface and contains the actual functionality.
- **Proxy**: Implements the Interface and controls access to the Service, adding additional behaviors such as caching or logging.
- **Client Code**: Uses the Proxy to access the Service, allowing the addition of extra functionality seamlessly.

## Usage

To implement the Proxy pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Interface**: Create an interface or abstract class that declares the common operations for both the Service and Proxy.

2. **Implement Service Class**: Create a class that implements the Interface and contains the real functionality.

3. **Implement Proxy Class**: Create a class that also implements the Interface and controls access to the Service. Add any additional behavior, such as logging or caching.

4. **Client Code**: Use the Proxy to access the Service, allowing the addition of features without modifying the client code.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the Proxy pattern to control access to objects, adding functionality such as caching, logging, or access control, without changing the client code.

## Variation

**Virtual Proxy**

- **Lazy Initialization**: The Virtual Proxy pattern is a specific type of proxy that initializes the service only when it is actually needed. This is useful for optimizing resource usage and improving performance.
- **Example Use Case**: For instance, a large image can be loaded only when it is about to be displayed on the screen, rather than loading it upfront.

**Protection Proxy**

- **Access Control**: The Protection Proxy pattern controls access to an object, ensuring that only authorized clients can interact with the service. It is commonly used in scenarios requiring security and permission checks.

The choice between different types of proxies depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the application.
