# Prototype Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Prototype design pattern is a creational design pattern that allows objects to be cloned or copied rather than being created from scratch. This pattern provides a way to create new instances by copying an existing instance, which can be more efficient when the cost of creating an object is substantial.

The Prototype pattern is particularly useful when you need to create a large number of similar objects or when object creation involves complex setup. By using prototypes, you can create new objects by copying an existing prototype, thus avoiding repetitive and costly initialization processes.

## Intent

The Prototype pattern aims to:

- Provide a mechanism to clone or copy objects instead of creating new instances from scratch.
- Simplify the creation of complex objects by duplicating an existing instance.
- Decouple the client code from the specifics of object creation, focusing instead on the cloning process.

## Motivation

In software development, there are scenarios where creating new instances of objects can be complex or costly. For example, if an object requires substantial setup or has numerous dependencies, creating a new instance each time can be inefficient.

The Prototype pattern addresses this by allowing objects to be cloned. Instead of initializing a new object from scratch, you can create a prototype and then clone it to produce new instances. This approach is especially beneficial when you have a common base or template from which to derive new objects.

## Structure

The Prototype pattern consists of the following components:

- **Prototype**: The interface or abstract base class that declares the cloning method. It defines the contract for cloning objects.
- **ConcretePrototype**: The classes that implement the Prototype interface and provide the specific implementation for cloning. Each ConcretePrototype class represents a specific type of object that can be cloned.
- **Client**: The code that uses the prototype to create new instances by cloning the existing prototype. The client code interacts with the Prototype interface, avoiding direct instantiation of concrete classes.

The typical flow of the Prototype pattern involves the following steps:

1. The client code obtains a reference to an existing prototype.
2. The client calls the `clone` method on the prototype to create a new instance.
3. The new instance is a copy of the original prototype, with the same attributes and state.
4. The client uses the cloned instance as needed.

## Participants

The main participants in the Prototype pattern are:

- **Prototype**: Declares the `clone` method that allows for copying the object.
- **ConcretePrototype**: Implements the `clone` method to provide a specific cloning process and creates copies of the object with the same attributes.
- **Client**: Uses the prototype to create new instances by cloning, without needing to understand the details of object creation.

## Usage

To implement the Prototype pattern, follow these steps:

1. **Define the Prototype Interface**: Create an abstract base class or interface that declares the `clone` method. This method should be implemented by concrete prototype classes.

2. **Implement Concrete Prototypes**: Create classes that inherit from the Prototype interface and implement the `clone` method. These classes should define the cloning behavior specific to each type of object.

3. **Client Code**: Use the prototype instances to create new objects by calling the `clone` method. The client code interacts with prototypes and uses cloned instances as needed.

By following these steps, you can leverage the Prototype pattern to efficiently create and manage objects, especially when object creation is complex or involves significant setup.

## Variation

**Shallow Copy vs. Deep Copy**

- **Shallow Copy**: Creates a new object but does not create copies of nested objects. It copies the references to nested objects.
- **Deep Copy**: Creates a new object and recursively copies all nested objects, ensuring that the new object is fully independent of the original.

The Prototype pattern can use either shallow or deep copying depending on the requirements of the application.
