# Builder Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Builder design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a flexible solution for creating complex objects. It separates the construction of an object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

The Builder pattern is useful in situations where the creation of an object involves multiple steps, and the order or combination of these steps can vary. By encapsulating the construction logic within the Builder class, the client code can construct objects step by step without knowing the specific details of the construction process.

## Intent

The Builder pattern aims to:
- Separate the construction of a complex object from its representation.
- Allow the same construction process to create different representations.
- Provide a step-by-step construction process to create objects.

## Motivation

In some cases, objects can have complex creation processes with many optional parameters or steps. Using a constructor with numerous parameters can make the code hard to read and maintain. Additionally, if multiple constructors are used to support different combinations of parameters, the code may become cluttered.

The Builder pattern solves these problems by providing a clear separation between the construction process and the client code. It allows the client to construct objects step by step, specifying only the required parameters or steps. This approach improves code readability and maintainability.

## Structure

The Builder pattern consists of the following components:
- **Product**: Represents the complex object under construction.
- **Builder**: Abstract class or interface that defines the steps to construct the product.
- **ConcreteBuilder**: Implements the Builder interface to construct and assemble the parts of the product.
- **Director**: Controls the construction process using the Builder interface.
- **Client**: Uses the Director to construct the object.

The typical flow of the Builder pattern involves the following steps:
1. The client creates a builder object and a director object.
2. The client sets the builder object in the director.
3. The director constructs the object by executing the builder's step-by-step construction methods.
4. The client retrieves the constructed object from the builder.

## Participants

The main participants in the Builder pattern are:
- **Product**: Represents the object being constructed.
- **Builder**: Declares the construction steps for building the product.
- **ConcreteBuilder**: Implements the construction steps defined by the Builder interface.
- **Director**: Controls the construction process and interacts with the builder to build the product.
- **Client**: Initiates the construction process by working with the Director.

## Usage

To implement the Builder pattern, follow these steps:

1. Create the **Product** class that represents the complex object to be constructed. It should have appropriate fields and methods to represent the object's properties and behaviors.

2. Define the **Builder** interface or abstract class that declares the construction methods for building the product. These methods should represent the individual steps of the construction process.

3. Implement the **ConcreteBuilder** class(es) that implement the Builder interface. Each ConcreteBuilder should provide its own implementation for constructing the product.

4. Create the **Director** class that controls the construction process. The Director should have a reference to the Builder interface and use its methods to construct the product.

5. Finally, the **Client** code should create the Builder and Director objects. It should set the Builder object in the Director and then invoke the Director's construction methods. After the construction is complete, the Client can retrieve the constructed product from the Builder.
