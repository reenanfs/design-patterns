# Singleton Design Pattern

## Introduction

The Singleton design pattern is a creational design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It involves defining a mechanism to control access to the single instance while allowing the instance itself to be lazy-loaded or eagerly loaded based on the implementation.

## Intent

The Singleton pattern aims to:

- Ensure a class has only one instance and provide a global point of access to it.
- Provide a way to access the instance without creating a new one every time.
- Allow the singleton instance to be lazily instantiated when it is first requested or eagerly instantiated when the application starts.

## Motivation

In software design, there are scenarios where it's crucial to have exactly one instance of a class, such as managing access to a shared resource or coordinating actions across the system. The Singleton pattern addresses these requirements by ensuring that a class has only one instance and providing a global access point to that instance.

By controlling how the instance is created and accessed, the Singleton pattern offers a centralized approach to managing resources and ensuring consistent behavior throughout the application.

## Structure

The Singleton pattern typically consists of the following components:

- **Singleton**: Defines a static method or property that returns the single instance of the class. It ensures that no other instances of the class can be created.
- **Instance**: The unique instance of the Singleton class that is created either lazily or eagerly, depending on the implementation.
- **Client**: Code that accesses the Singleton instance through the static method or property provided by the Singleton class.

The structure ensures that the Singleton class has only one instance throughout the application's lifecycle, providing global access to that instance whenever necessary.

## Participants

The main participant in the Singleton pattern is:

- **Singleton**: Defines a static method or property that returns the single instance of itself. It may also include methods and properties to provide functionality using the singleton instance.

## Usage

To implement the Singleton pattern, consider the following approach:

1. **Private Constructor**: Ensure the Singleton class has a private constructor to prevent direct instantiation from external classes.

2. **Static Instance**: Define a private static member variable within the Singleton class to hold the single instance of the class.

3. **Singleton Access Method**: Implement a public static method (typically named `getInstance()`) that acts as a factory method to return the singleton instance. This method should ensure that only one instance is created and returned.

4. **Accessing the Singleton**: Access the Singleton instance using the `getInstance()` method from any part of the code where the Singleton functionality is needed.

By following this approach, you can ensure that your Singleton class has only one instance throughout the application, providing a global access point to that instance.

## Variation

Thread-Safe Singleton

In scenarios where multiple threads may concurrently access the Singleton instance, a thread-safe version of the Singleton pattern can be implemented. This ensures that the instance is created only once and is accessed in a thread-safe manner, preventing potential issues with concurrent access.
